Add custom CSS to your WordPress Posts and Pages.

== Description ==
This plugin will add a simple box in your Posts and Pages edit screens which will give you the awesome ability to add custom CSS to *that particular* post or page! All you have to do is add your CSS code in the newly formed box!

All this plugin does is wrap your CSS in &lt;style&gt; tags and then insert that block into your post or page's HTML code. Pretty neat, isn't it?

This approach is much better than what CCSS does, a rather popular plugin, which requires you to create a separate style sheet and add it to your themes folder via FTP. (*whoosh, too much work!*)

Also, this plugin is *dead hassle free.* Just install it and it'll automatically add the boxes to your post and page's edit screens. Unlike WP Post Styling, another popular plugin, which will overwhelm you with too many setting options!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After adding the CSS in the box, I can't see the changes when I click on "Preview Changes" =

Sometimes, you won't be able to see the changes after clicking the "Preview Changes" button. The catch here is click on it again so that the Preview will refresh itself, and then you'll be able to see the changes.

We are working on fixing this. But as of now, just preview the post/page two times and you'll be good to go!
